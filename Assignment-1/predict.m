function p = predict(theta, X)
%PREDICT Predict whether the label is 0 or 1 using learned logistic regression parameters theta
%   p = PREDICT(theta, X) computes the predictions for X using a threshold at 0.5.

m = size(X, 1); % Number of training examples

% You need to return the following variables correctly
p = zeros(m, 1);


%%%%%_______q9. Compute the hypothesis for theta and X (5 marks)

%%%%%_______q10. The prediction vector p should contain 1s or 0s depending on the values of the 
%%%%%_______     hypothesis for each particular training example using threshold 0.5. (3 marks)
